# Workout Path Generator


* [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)
* [Weekly Report](docs/report.md)

### Real Life Scenario:
* Many individuals enjoy exercising outdoors, but do not know where to exercise. When we take a random path and start exploring, sometimes we encounter a lot of traffic, potholes, and other issues.
* While exercising outdoors, it can become a hassle to track your workouts - how much distance, what speed, how long, etc. Keeping up the consistency can become difficult when the progress is not obvious. 

### Problem Statement: 
* Provide users a low-friction method to find a workout path. This can be starting and ending at the root location, having a specified distance.
* Produce regular reports on user's exercise, designed to enhance their own personal commitment.

### Development Approach:
1. Create portal to take user input, of location and distance, and plot on a map appropriately.
2. Make an algorithm to find an A to A path of specified distance.
3. Output multiple path options.
Continued: There are *MANY* more ways to streamline this project. Begin with providing paths within the same locality, that is they should be contained in a certain contour.
